    This <a> tag can wrap e.g., a banner image. It should only be shown for users likely to
    support RCS messaging from their current device, which currently means only Android devices
    in the UK. 

    The "publication" parameter should match the id of your CFP publication. This example
    refers to the UK version of Hollywood.com.
